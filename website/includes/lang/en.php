    "japan_day0arrival_preface" => "I started posting pictures on Instagram about last year's trip to Japan and it was taking a lot of time to write the stories to the pictures. 
            I really wanted to share my experiences to also save them for myself to remember for the future. But the format on Instagram wasn't really working for me, since you cannot directly relate an image to what you are describing 
            and limiting the word count in the description made it hard to finish what I wanted to tell. Since it also limits the images to only include ones with the same format, I decided to share my stories with you here instead.",
    "japan_day0arrival_p1" => "Traveling alone on a plane for the first time - and then directly to the other side of the world - was honestly making me anxious, rightfully so. 
            A month of preparation could never have prepared me for the shock when arriving somewhere foreign, without any support until you figure it out yourself. 
            I can really recommend it to anyone to try, its really good at making you grow.",
    "japan_day0arrival_p2" => "Japan itself was not as 'culture shocking' as people always make you believe. 
            It was still just a city, just people. Just a different language, different food and different customs but for me it still felt comforting. 
            It may sound presumptuous to say that my way of thinking and behaving resounds well with theirs but to me it truly felt so.",
    "japan_day0arrival_p3" => "Maybe it was the years of slowly learning a little bit of the Japanese language, customs and culture that also slowly transformed my behaviour, maybe its something different. 
            It is that feeling of tranquility and pureness that I really got to enjoy over the trip.",
    "japan_day0arrival_p4" => "I got to enjoy a lot of different things that I already dearly miss, starting from the first day already.
            Just the vending machines at every corner, not just in the city, the different softdrinks like Calpis Soda, white Peach soda, cold green tea or just coffee 
            - the convenience of never having to pack drinks for your whole trip in advance but just find them cheaply wherever you go was just incredible. ",
    "japan_day0arrival_p5" => "Not to talk about convenience stores.. They do live up to their name, not just donning a variety of cold bevarages, ready to eat meals in all kinds (and healthy too), 
            what surprised me the most was the 'hot refridgerators' storing drinks heated up but presented like a normal supermarket fridge would. Just getting a hot instant coffee instead of a cold one if you felt like it... ",
    "japan_day0arrival_p7" => "When arriving there I continued on my unlucky streak: After not finding the way to the train station at the airport I was down to an hour in the hostel before the meeting with the travel group.
            In that time I had to fill out the hostel's registration form and deposit my luggage in our room. Then I was lucky to meet one of the others of our group who helped me after I didn't manage to open the room with the provided password for multiple minutes.
            And as it couldn't get any worse, with only 20minutes to spare I got a nosebleed. At this point I was completely stressed out and had to wait for it to stop so I could just get ready. In the end I just quickly changed into a new shirt before following the rest to our group meeting.",
    "japan_day0arrival_p8" => "Afterwards we went together to a local japanese diner to eat and I realized I could read half of the drink menu cause they were all written in Katakana, so I started translating for my fellow travellers 
            who didn't know any Japanese besides a quick 'Konnichi wa' and 'Arigatou'. It was really fun getting to know every one of them and talking and eating together. It just instantly clicked with them.",
    "japan_day0arrival_p9" => "The tight space in the hostel room with 6 people together and no room to even open your bag and take out your things also was a challenge. One guy had to even go outside onto the hallway just to get his toothbrush out of his bag. 
    Just a comepletely different environment to stay in. But as I met with all these people from around the world, I had already started to thoroughly enjoy it.",
