    "japan_day0arrival_preface" => "I started posting pictures on Instagram about last year's trip to Japan and it was taking a lot of time to write the stories to the pictures. 
            I really wanted to share my experiences to also save them for myself to remember for the future. But the format on Instagram wasn't really working for me, since you cannot directly relate an image to what you are describing 
            and limiting the word count in the description made it hard to finish what I wanted to tell. Since it also limits the images to only include ones with the same format, I decided to share my stories with you here instead.",
    "japan_day0arrival_p1" => "Traveling alone on a plane for the first time - and then directly to the other side of the world - was honestly making me anxious, rightfully so. 
            A month of preparation could never have prepared me for the shock when arriving somewhere foreign, without any support until you figure it out yourself. 
            I can really recommend it to anyone to try, its really good at making you grow.",
    "japan_day0arrival_p2" => "Japan itself was not as 'culture shocking' as people always make you believe. 
            It was still just a city, just people. Just a different language, different food and different customs but for me it still felt comforting. 
            It may sound presumptuous to say that my way of thinking and behaving resounds well with theirs but to me it truly felt so.",
    "japan_day0arrival_p3" => "Maybe it was the years of slowly learning a little bit of the Japanese language, customs and culture that also slowly transformed my behaviour, maybe its something different. 
            It is that feeling of tranquility and pureness that I really got to enjoy over the trip.",
    "japan_day0arrival_p4" => "I got to enjoy a lot of different things that I already dearly miss, starting from the first day already.
            Just the vending machines at every corner, not just in the city, the different softdrinks like Calpis Soda, white Peach soda, cold green tea or just coffee 
            - the convenience of never having to pack drinks for your whole trip in advance but just find them cheaply wherever you go was just incredible. ",
    "japan_day0arrival_p5" => "Not to talk about convenience stores.. They do live up to their name, not just donning a variety of cold bevarages, ready to eat meals in all kinds (and healthy too), 
            what surprised me the most was the 'hot refridgerators' storing drinks heated up but presented like a normal supermarket fridge would. Just getting a hot instant coffee instead of a cold one if you felt like it... ",
    "japan_day0arrival_p7" => "When arriving there I continued on my unlucky streak: After not finding the way to the train station at the airport I was down to an hour in the hostel before the meeting with the travel group.
            In that time I had to fill out the hostel's registration form and deposit my luggage in our room. Then I was lucky to meet one of the others of our group who helped me after I didn't manage to open the room with the provided password for multiple minutes.
            And as it couldn't get any worse, with only 20minutes to spare I got a nosebleed. At this point I was completely stressed out and had to wait for it to stop so I could just get ready. In the end I just quickly changed into a new shirt before following the rest to our group meeting.",
    "japan_day0arrival_p8" => "Afterwards we went together to a local japanese diner to eat and I realized I could read half of the drink menu cause they were all written in Katakana, so I started translating for my fellow travellers 
            who didn't know any Japanese besides a quick 'Konnichi wa' and 'Arigatou'. It was really fun getting to know every one of them and talking and eating together. It just instantly clicked with them.",
    "japan_day0arrival_p9" => "The tight space in the hostel room with 6 people together and no room to even open your bag and take out your things also was a challenge. One guy had to even go outside onto the hallway just to get his toothbrush out of his bag. 
    Just a comepletely different environment to stay in. But as I met with all these people from around the world, I had already started to thoroughly enjoy it.",

    // FOOD
    // Matcha Tutorial
    "food_matchaTutorial_heading" => "Matcha Tutorial",
    "food_matchaTutorial_preface" => "I have had two particular passions for a long time now: Food and Japan. For a long time I already started to combinge them.
            One of the more simlpe but also exceedingly complex ingredients in Japanese cuisine is Matcha. I think at this point nearly everyone already knows about it,
            and some love it, some hate it. So to start my journey in sharing all the incredible recipes I make frequently, I want to share this basic way of preparing the 
            wonderful drink of matcha. No Latte, no sugar, just the tea powder itself. It is said to be incredibly healthy but I don't really care about that.
            For me it's the taste and the ritual of it in the morning to start my day, thats exciting. And I want to take you along.",
    "food_matchaTutorial_p1" => "To start off, you only need 3 things: A mug with a wide base, a whisk (preferrably a matcha whisk) and Matcha powder. I would recommand using
            a precision scale to weigh the ingredients and a kettle, that can show the temperature because without those the process is less consistent - but they are not needed.
            The first, and most important step is to preheat and soak the matcha whisk, by placing it in the cup and filling it with 70Â°C hot water and then leave it for 2 minutes.
            This is crucial, because it makes the bamboo soft so you don't end up with wooden splinters in your matcha. Then discard the water and place the whisk to the side and 
            weigh 1.5-2g of matcha powdert into the mug. With these low amounts just taking a teaspoon is fine too, but it will always be different, with a scale you can observe which amount works best for you.",
    "food_matchaTutorial_p2" => "The second most important thing is to break up the clumps of powder in a little amount of water to make it as smooth as possible. 
            That's where a matcha whisk is paramount, because a normal whisk is too round at the bottom and not granular enough to really smoothen out everything.",
    "food_matchaTutorial_p3" => "In the past I always had problems with the matcha being clumpy or having a bunch of powder at the bottom, if you take the correct amounts and whisk correctly, that's not going to happen.
            So just add a little bit of the 70Â°C water to the powder and then whisk it until everything feels smooth and no clumps are visible anymore, that's the easiest when it is really thick.",
    "food_matchaTutorial_p4" => "Only then you should add the whole amount of water and whisk it properly. For this amount of matcha and a normal cup, add about 80ml (80g) of 70Â°C hot water
            and whisk it until it is foamy. The key to using a matcha whisk (and I have to thank Sensei Matcha Samurai for the explanation) is to not use a circular motion, but a linear one
            with as little strength as possible. Just use a relaxed hand and whisk front and back quickly until it foams up, then slowly make one circle to spread the foam around the whole cup - that's it.",
    "food_matchaTutorial_p5" => "I know the explanation was pretty long but when you try it out and know what to do, it's just really easy and works every time. If you use the right temperature of
            water and make it properly the taste is going to be amazing (if you like the grassy flavor). Even with really cheap Matcha (I use one that is 5â‚¬ for 80g from China) it shouldn't taste bitter.
            That's probably a sign that your water was too hot. One last important thing is to clean the whisk under running water and use a matcha whisk stand to spread out the whisk while drying.
            This will make sure that even after using it for a long time that it stays wide open, otherwise it will quickly shrink or get uneven, so I definitely recommand to get one, to not treat the whisk like a consumable.",
