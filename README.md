# Blog
Personal blog ("Gruppe" 7)

## Add new pages
Copy ./template.php to use as a template for all pages. EVERY name of a .php file has to be UNIQUE to ALL other .php blog files and only be made of alphanumerics and underscores!

## Set up website
### Start webserver
In project root, to start apache webserver and mysql database in blog_default docker-network:
```cmd
docker compose up -d
```
Or, if docker config/image is changed or starting for the first time:
```cmd
docker compose up --build
```
Check if everything is running:
```cmd
docker ps
```
### Open website
In Browser, open `localhost:80` to open the homepage.
### Stop webserver
```cmd
docker compose down
```

## Debug website
### Use mysql console

```cmd
docker exec -it blog_mysql bash
```
Login to database inside mysql container, when asked type in the password found in docker_compose.yaml in the MYSQL_PASSWORD env variable.
```bash
mysql -u julian -p blogdb
julianpassword
```
Example for mysql commands: List databases
```mysql
SHOW databases;
```
List tables in database
```mysql
SHOW TABLES;
```
Select the blog database
```mysql
USE blogdb;
```
Show the contents of a table
